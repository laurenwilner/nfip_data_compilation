## Background

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">

  <!-- Left column: Text -->
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: -10px;">

- Floods accounted for the majority of 4 million climate change attributable deaths from 2000–2024.<sup>1-4</sup>  
- **Flood frequency is expected to triple** from 2020 to 2050.<sup>5</sup>  
- Floods are associated with **elevated mortality rates**. <sup>3, 4, 6, 7-13</sup>
  </div>

## FEMA programs
Two U.S. federal programs aim to **prevent and mitigate flood effects** and reduce mortality risk among older adults:  
<br>
<br>
<div class="center">

1. **FEMA National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):** Provides flood insurance for homes and properties.  
2. **Individuals and Households Program (IHP):** Offers financial and direct services to individuals. 

</div>

<br>
<br>

These programs promote **housing security** and reduce the **financial burden** after floods. We hypothesize that they buffer the effects of floods on health and mortality, though epidemiologic studies of them are limited. 



## National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)

- Goals of FEMA's NFIP:<sup>15</sup> 
  - Reduce financial burden due to flood damage by providing public and private flood insurance options
  - Incentives communities to adopt floodplain management regulations and build in safer areas
- Not universally available. 
- Availability relies on a community opting into the program and the community's flood risk designation.
- **No comprehensive, nationwide spatial dataset of NFIP designations, policies, and claims.**

## NFIP designations across the United States
A primary goal of this project is to create this comprehensive, nationwide spatial dataset of NFIP designations, policies, and claims. We will focus on part I for this presentation.

<br>

 **Part I: Designations**
 <br> 

 NFIP has three mutually exclusive categories across the US. 
 <br> 

 We combine **FEMA’s SFHA (required NFIP) shapefile** with their **geodatabase of locations where NFIP is available (required or optional NFIP) or unavailable** to create a continuous NFIP designation surface. 

<br>

```{r nfip-table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Define the data
nfip_table <- data.frame(
  `NFIP Designation` = c(
    "Required in federally designated special flood hazard areas (SFHAs)",
    "Optional in communities that have opted into the program",
    "Unavailable"
  ),
  `Data Source` = c(
    "FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) that identifies SFHAs",
    "FEMA's NFIP designation geodatabase with SFHAs filtered out",
    "Locations outside NFHL & FEMA's NFIP database"
  )
)

# Render the table with styling
kable(
  nfip_table, 
  col.names = c("NFIP Designation", "Data Source"), # Custom labels
  align = c("l", "l"), 
  booktabs = TRUE, 
  escape = FALSE
) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
```

<!-- <div style="flex: 5; text-align: center;"> -->
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
include_graphics("~/Desktop/Desktop/epidemiology_PhD/00_repos/nfip_data_compilation/plots/aim1_nfip_pnw.png")
```

## Next steps

<br>

1. Include NFIP policies and claims data in the spatial dataset.
2. Determine the meaning of missing areas in these source datasets. 
3. Analyze the spatial distribution of NFIP designations, policies, and claims across the US.
4. Make dataset publicly available for other researchers to use.
